Hi, Iâ€™m Tobi. I'm a Software Engineer based in Germany. I care about way too many things including programming languages, software architecture, engineering culture and basically everything which catches my interest.

I don't like to put myself in a technology pigeonhole but a problem solver.

If you want to learn more about me, you can:

- Checkout my account on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/4567795/twobiers"><img src="https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=%E2%80%8B&message=StackOverflow&color=ef8236&style=flat-square&logo=stackoverflow" /></a>, where I ask stupid questions.

Occasionally I try to write blog posts about things I care about on my [Blog](https://twobiers.github.io/posts/).
